# Week Two: 5/11 - 5/15

I am only going to touch on the highlights of the week! :smile:

## git status, git add, git commit, git push (still forget this one!) :smile:

### Monday, May 11th

We began this week with a pop quiz!! :scream: I felt that I knew most of the answers to the questions, but that I could not (for the life of me) pull them out of my brain! Other than the pop quiz today was a review day. We had a _parking lot_ where we would put all of the issues that we had over the weekend that we feel need to be discussed over the course of the day. The _parking lot_ helped to organize the topics that everyone was struggling with over the weekend.

For our assignment we were doing the Yak Shavings for the week.

### Tuesday, May 12th - Thursday, May 14th

Oh this week with all of it's Nested Accordions, Full Width Tabs, and TodoMVC's. I feel that the main lesson for this week was: YOU WILL MESS STUFF UP... AND FIX IT... AGAIN... AND AGAIN. Besides that lesson we learned about the [MVC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/Modern_web_app_architecture/MVC_architecture) (Model, View, Controller). The model defines what data the app should contain. The view is the interface, what the user interacts with. Then there is the controller, which is like the traffic cop between the two. It is still a hard concept to understand what goes in the controller vs. the model. I think that the more I work on this concept the more I will understand where things should be located.

### Friday, May 15th

Susanna spoke to us this week about job placement. During weeks 10 -11 of _This Iron Yard_ we will begin to have talks on job placement. These will consist of finding job listings, applying for jobs, a portfolio, a resume, a cover letter, how to dress at an interview, freelancing, etc. Between then and now there are things that we can do to improve our job placement at the end of _The Iron Yard_. We should begin to network, which I mentioned in last week's blog. We should be going to 1-2 meetups per month: one that is specific towards user groups (JavaScript, Fontend, etc.) and one general (Orando Tech, Wordpress Orlando, etc. ). Once at the meetup we should make it a pint to introduce ourself to the coordinator AND the speakers. This will begin to build our network.

The next step was to have a LinkedIn profile and a Twitter account. I already have both, but I do not use them. So my next step is to begin building them! :smile:


### What have I learned in Terminal?

Adding onto what I have previously learned:

hostname // the computer name

pwd // print working directory (where am I in this computer!)

cd // move to things

git add // stage a file to the repo

git commit // commit the files to the repo

```

#### Week Two

browser-sync start --server // connecting the file to a local server

```
