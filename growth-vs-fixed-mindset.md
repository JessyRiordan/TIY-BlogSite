# Part 3: Final Copy

Carol Dweck states that there are two types of mindsets that any one person can have: growth or fixed. Within a fixed mindset a person will be told that they are born gifted, that they have natural talents, and that their traits are set in stone. Within a growth mindset children will be told that success comes from effort, practice, and hard work. What mindset do you have and do you think you can change it?

One study confirmed the growth vs. fixed mindset theory. A group of children were given an easy test. They were then divided into two groups. One group was told "You did great on this, you must be really smart" and the other group was told "You did great on this, you must have tried really hard." The children were then given the option to take a harder test or a simple test. The group that was told they were smart chose to take the simpler test and the group that was told they worked hard chose the harder test. 

There are many situations in which you can attempt to figure out which mindset you are in: growth mindset or fixed mindset. Having been a teacher in a middle school math class it makes me think of the fixed mindset. When a student gets a good grade they are praised for being smart, not for the hard work they they may or may not have put into that assignment. The students are never praised for the effort that they are putting into their assignments. What would happen if theses students were told throughout the process that they are a hard worker? 

Having been a swimmer in high school, I ran into many instances that I did not come in first place in a race. My mother always told me that I did a great job because I was trying. The next time that I swam I would try harder, and ultimately swim faster. That does not mean that I earned first place, but I was still praised for the effort that I was putting in. My mother was instilling into me the growth mindset. I kept trying, I never gave up. 

I will apply this knowledge of the growth and fixed mindset to my time with The Iron Yard. I understand that I will fail. I need to tell myself that I put in as much effort as I could for that project or for that homework assignment. I will get myself into the growth mindset just by telling myself that it is the journey, not the destination. 

# Part 2: Rough Draft

Carol Dweck states that there are two types of mindsets that any one person can have; growth or fixed. Within a fixed mindset a person will be told that they are born gifted, theat they have natural talents, and theat their traits are set in stone. Within a growth mindset children will be told that success comes from effort, practice, and hard work. One study confirmed the growth vs. fixed mindet theory. A group of children were given an easy test. They were then divided into two groups. One group was told "You did great on this, you must be really smart" and the other group was told "You did great on this, you must have tired really hard." The children were then given the option to take a harder test or a simple test. The group that was told they were smart chose to take the simpler test and the group that was told the worked hard chose the harder test. 

Being a teacher in a middle school math class makes me think of the fixed mindset. When a student gets a good grade they are praised for being smart. The students are never praised for the effort that they are putting into the work that is bing completed. Swimming in high school makes me think of the growth mindset. My mother always told me that it was the effort that I put into my swim that mattered, not the place that I received. 

I will apply this knowledge to my time with The Iron Yard. I understand that I will fail. I need to tell myself that I put in as much effort as I could for that project, for that homework assignment. I will get myself into the grwoth mindset just by telling myself that it it e journey, not the destination.
