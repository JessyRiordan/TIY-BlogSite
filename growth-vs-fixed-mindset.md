# Part 3: Final Copy

Carol Dweck states that there are two types of mindsets that any one person can have; growth or fixed. Within a fixed mindset a person will be told that they are born gifted, that they have natural talents, and that their traits are set in stone. Within a growth mindset children will be told that success comes from effort, practice, and hard work. One study confirmed the growth vs. fixed mindet theory. A group of children were given an easy test. They were then divided into two groups. One group was told "You did great on this, you must be really smart" and the other group was told "You did great on this, you must have tired really hard." The children were then given the option to take a harder test or a simple test. The group that was told they were smart chose to take the simpler test and the group that was told the worked hard chose the harder test. 

Being a teacher in a middle school math class makes me think of the fixed mindset. When a student gets a good grade they are praised for being smart. The students are never praised for the effort that they are putting into the work that is bing completed. Swimming in high school makes me think of the growth mindset. My mother always told me that it was the effort that I put into my swim that mattered, not the place that I received. 

I will apply this knowledge to my time with The Iron Yard. I understand that I will fail. I need to tell myself that I put in as much effort as I could for that project, for that homework assignment. I will get myself into the grwoth mindset just by telling myself that it it e journey, not the destination.
