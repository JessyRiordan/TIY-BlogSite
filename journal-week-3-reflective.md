## Networking is Important?

### Not Twitter Again!

Before coming to _The Iron Yard_ I tried to get into the whole tweeting about everyting I do and see. I just could not get into it. It was a website/app that I just did not utilize on a daily basis. I think I may have spent one day following [@weatherchannel](https://twitter.com/weatherchannel) about tornadoes or hurricanes. Overall, I did not think of Twitter as useful.

_The Iron Yard_ has has taught me to cultivate a network/online presence. This was first discussed when Susanna spoke with our cohort about what we could do now to help with job placement in the future. She mentioned that having a Twitter account would be very useful. We could use the accountto follow other _Iron Yard_ members and important people/organizations in the programming community. 

Having gone to the _Front End Design Conference_ in St. Pete this past week I feel that I now fully understand why Twitter so important! Each speakeer had a Twitter account, that I am now following. The conference even had a Twitter account, that I am following too! Following #frontendconf during the conference I saw how others were perceiving the conference.

Overall, I have learned that I can not be antisocial on the social media sites. I have to make my presence known and get my name out there. Twitter is just the beginning!
