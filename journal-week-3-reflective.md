## Important?

The most valuable lesson that I have learned thus far at _The Iron Yard_ has been to cultivate a network/online presence. This was first discussed when Susanna spoke with our cohort about what we could do now to help with job placement in the future. She mentioned that we should go to meetups, have a twitter account, and have a LinkedIn account. She also briefly mentioned our portfolio, which would be used to help find jobs at the end of our 12 weeks here. 

Having gone to the _Front End Design Conference_ in St. Pete this past week I feel that I now fully understand why this is all so important! Each speakeer had a twitter account, that I am now following. The conference even had a twitter account! Following #frontendconf during the conference I saw how others were perceiving the conference.
