##Feeling the Stress

Over the course of my time at _The Iron Yard_ I have been upbeat and excited about everything. I come home and _*WANT*_ to complete my assignments. I find them super enjoyable, even with the challenges that come with them. I even _*WILLINGLY*_ went to the _FrontEnd Design Conference_, something that in my previous career would _*NOT*_ have happened.

During this past week I have started to feel overwhelmed and stressed. The information just keeps piling up and I do not feel like I have time to process any of it. I am the type of person/learner that needs time to process what I have learned. Specifically, I need time to manipulate the information. Because the past two weeks have been a little hectic I do not feel as though I have had adequate time to process all of the information in my own way.

What can I do differently? I should make more time to go back to previous information. I focus so much on the topic at hand that I loose sight of all the information that has already been learned. Hopefully, the review week will help with this process.
