### Halftime

This past week was halftime week at _The Iron Yard_! I can not believe that I have already been here for four weeks! It is very exciting, but very overwhelming knowing that there are only four more weeks of instruction and then I am on my own to complete a final project.

At the beginning of this week I felt that I really needed to get more practice with JavaScript. But I felt that with the amount of work/multiple projects that were given to us, I spent more time working on HTML and CSS. I did not get the 'review' that I wanted for myself pertaining the JavaScript. I know that I will need to spend more time working on perfecting that skill outside of the school assignments. However, I feel more comfortable with HTML and CSS now! So that is a plus. :smile:
