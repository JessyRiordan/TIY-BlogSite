### Meet the Ipsums

[Meet the Ipsums](http://meettheipsums.com/)

When designing, or re-designing, a website you will most likely need filler text. _Meet the Ipsums_ is a valuable resource that will provide you with filler text. This text will most likely not make any sense, it will be a bunch of words thrown together.

_Meet the Ipsums_ does not generate the filler text. It will link you to ipsums all over the interwebs.

The basic (and maybe most popular) ipsum is [Lorem Ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/). An example of the filler text that it will give you is:

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vestibulum fermentum tincidunt turpis. 
```

My favorite ipsum is the [Dr. Who Ipsum](http://doctoripsum.com/). An example of the filler text that it will give you is:

```
I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. Allons-y! Goodbye...my Sarah Jane!

```
