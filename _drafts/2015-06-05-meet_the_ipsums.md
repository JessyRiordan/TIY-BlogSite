### Meet the Ipsums

[Meet the Ipsums](http://meettheipsums.com/)

When designing, or re-designing, a website you will most likely need filler text. _Meet the Ipsums_ is a valuable resource that will provide you with filler text. This text will most likely not make any sense, it will be a bunch of words thrown together.

_Meet the Ipsums_ does not generate the filler text. It will link you to ipsums all over the interwebs.

The basic (and maybe most popular) ipsum is [Lorem Ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/). An example of the filler text that it will give you is:

```
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vestibulum fermentum tincidunt turpis. Proin a elementum velit, a scelerisque dui. Proin non mi semper, commodo nulla id, tempor eros. Nam nec rhoncus orci. Donec cursus tempus odio sed facilisis. Nulla id lacus id diam imperdiet efficitur. Aenean rhoncus rhoncus ligula, sed tincidunt massa malesuada eu. Sed commodo vehicula euismod. Morbi ac sodales nulla.

```

My favorite ipsum is the [Dr. Who Ipsum](http://doctoripsum.com/). An example of the filler text that it will give you is:

```
I don't want to go. I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? New-new-Doctor. I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso! You can spend the rest of your life with me, but I can't spend the rest of mine with you. I have to live on. Alone. That's the curse of the Time Lords. Allons-y! Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'.

```
