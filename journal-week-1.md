# Week One: 5/4 - 5/8

I am only going to touch on the highlights of the week! :smile:

## git status, git add, git commit, git push (always forget this one!) :smile:

### Monday, May 4th

Today was the first day at _The Iron Yard_. Oh lord, what have I gotten myself into! :smile: The topic today: class structure and reviewing homework from pre-work. Everyday we will begin with a stand up meeting. We will all have to state our name, a bright bulb, a dim bulb, and a blocker. The bright bulb will be something that you totally understood, that makes sense for now! The dim bulb is something that you think you did right, but you do not understand how you did it. The blocker is something that you just did not understand, that you could not complete! We took today to orient ourselves with terminal and GitHub. We also began researching the growth vs. fixed mindset. During the reserach I realized that I have to have a growth mindset towards this entire _Iron Yard_ course. 

### Wednesday, May 6th

Today began with our stand up meeting. The blocker for me was the JavaScript definitions. I am trying to completely understand the concept before I write the definition. This is a weakness of mine that I need to correct! :smile: Moving onto the lesson, today we learned about User Stories. The basic format for a User Story is: "A **someone** can do **something** so that **someone** can get **some** benefit". The smurf (easy) way to reember the format is: "A **smurf** can **smurf** so that **smurfs** can **smurf**". Before you write a User Stories for what you want to creat you must first brainstorm about what that "thing" needs to do. We were brainstorming about a todo app. What does a todo app need to do? This todo app should: add something, check the something off, list all the somethings, delete the somethings, prioritize something, and edit something. 

### Friday, May 8th

Today began with a group meeting for all of _The Iron Yard_. We went around the room and had to state our names, one thing that went well this week, and one thing that did not go well this week. It was a fun little thing to do to get to know everyone that I did not know yet. Once the meeting was over we went over to _Echo_ for a "tour". Once back at _The Iron Yard_ we got to hear from

### What have I learned in Terminal?

These are only a few....

```
whoami // my username

hostname // the computer name

pwd // print working directory (where am I in this computer!)

cd // move to things

git status // find out the status of my repo

git add // stage a file to the repo

git commit // commit the files to the repo

```
