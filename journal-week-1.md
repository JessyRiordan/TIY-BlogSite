#### Week One: 5/4 - 5/8

### Monday, May 4th

Today was the first day at _The Iron Yard_. Oh lord, what have I gotten myself into! :smile: The topic today: class structure and reviewing homework from pre-work. Everyday we will begin with a stand up meeting. We will all have to state our name, a bright bulb, a dim bulb, and a blocker. The bright bulb will be something that you totally understood, that makes sense for now! The dim bulb is something that you think you did right, but you do not understand how you did it. The blocker is something that you just did not understand, that you could not complete!
