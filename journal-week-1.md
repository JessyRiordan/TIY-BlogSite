# Week One: 5/4 - 5/8

## git status, git add, git commit, git push (always forget this one!) :smile:

### Monday, May 4th

Today was the first day at _The Iron Yard_. Oh lord, what have I gotten myself into! :smile: The topic today: class structure and reviewing homework from pre-work. Everyday we will begin with a stand up meeting. We will all have to state our name, a bright bulb, a dim bulb, and a blocker. The bright bulb will be something that you totally understood, that makes sense for now! The dim bulb is something that you think you did right, but you do not understand how you did it. The blocker is something that you just did not understand, that you could not complete! We took today to orient ourselves with terminal and GitHub. We also began researching the growth vs. fixed mindset. During the reserach I realized that I have to have a growth mindset towards this entire _Iron Yard_ course. 

### Tuesday, May 5th

Today began with our stand up meeting. The blocker for me was the JavaScript definitions. I am trying to completely understand the concept before I write the definition. This is a weakness of mine that I need to correct! :smile: Moving onto the lesson, today we learned about User Stories. The basic format for a User Story is: "A **someone** can do **something** so that **someone** can get **some** benefit. The smurf (easy) way to reember the format is: "A **smurf** can **smurf** so that **smurfs** can **smurf**.
